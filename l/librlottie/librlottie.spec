%description
rlottie is a platform independent standalone c++ library
for rendering vector based animations and art in realtime.

Lottie loads and renders animations and vectors exported
in the bodymovin JSON format.
Bodymovin JSON can be created and exported
from After Effects with bodymovin,
Sketch with Lottie Sketch Export, and from Haiku.

For the first time, designers can create and ship beautiful
animations without an engineer painstakingly recreating it by hand.
Since the animation is backed by JSON they are extremely
small in size but can be large in complexity!
