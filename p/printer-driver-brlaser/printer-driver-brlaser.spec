%description
brlaser is a CUPS driver for Brother laser printers.

Although most Brother printers support a standard
printer language such as PCL or PostScript, not all do.
If you have a monochrome Brother laser printer (or multi-function device)
and the other open source drivers don't work, this one might help.

This driver has been reported to work with these printers:
